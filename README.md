# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Leverage Tableau to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Canada's real estate landscape over the last 40 years, addressing key questions and providing valuable insights using graphs. Utilize appropriate visualizations to showcase trends, comparisons, and correlations within the data. Ensure accuracy in unit consistency and focus on extracting meaningful patterns, trends.


## Process
### (your step 1)
Step 1: Leverage Excel and Python to explore and clean the data (remove null, remove special characters after JSON extract, etc)

### (your step 2)
Step 2: Import the Cleaned dataset into Tableau
### (step 3)
Step 3: Developing visualizations and trends to explore the dataset to answer the questions 

## Results
1. Option selected - 1
2. Show the trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years (table housing_price_index).
3. Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices in table real_estate_prices to see if there are any differences.
4. Compare this trend with the trend of office prices. Which one is getting more expensive, faster?
5. Create a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district.
6. Are the price differences between different districts increasing?
7. Compare the trend of house prices with earnings. *In case you want to plot monthly salary, be aware that the earnings value is per week.
8. Compare the trend of house prices with earnings. *In case you want to plot monthly salary, be aware that the earnings value is per week.
9. There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises
10. Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. Can we predict consumer_index from the housing_price_index?
11. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above questions.
HINT : Double check all units in the table before any comparison.
